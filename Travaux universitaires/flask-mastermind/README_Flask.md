# Flask Project – Mastermind Game

This project was developed during the second semester of my Master 1 as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course.

The objective of the project was to design and implement a software application based on the Mastermind game, applying core object-oriented programming principles.
The project was developed in Python and relies on the Flask framework to provide an interactive web-based interface.

This work allowed me to practice code structuring, class design, business logic implementation, and the interaction between the backend and the user interface.
