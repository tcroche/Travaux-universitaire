# Econometric Project – BRL/USD Exchange Rate

This project was carried out during my Master 1 as part of applied econometrics coursework.

The objective was to conduct an in-depth econometric analysis of the exchange rate between the Brazilian real (BRL) and the US dollar (USD).
The analysis focused on modeling exchange rate dynamics, including the identification of structural breaks, the treatment of multicollinearity, and the implementation of standard diagnostic tests.

The econometric diagnostics include the Breusch–Pagan and White tests for heteroskedasticity, as well as the Durbin–Watson test for residual autocorrelation.
The baseline model explains 70.31% of the variation in the exchange rate, while the refined specification achieves an R² of 0.9021, with diagnostic tests indicating the absence of heteroskedasticity and residual autocorrelation.
