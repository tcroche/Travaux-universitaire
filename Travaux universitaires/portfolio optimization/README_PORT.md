# Python Project – ETF Analysis and Anonymized Portfolio Allocations

This project was developed as part of a quantitative finance Python project.
It focuses on the analysis of a universe of 105 anonymized exchange-traded funds (ETFs), 14 broad asset classes, and two anonymized portfolios (“Mystery Allocations”) constructed from these ETFs.

The objectives of the project are threefold:
- to analyze the risk and performance profiles of ETFs;
- to study the relationships between ETFs and broad asset classes;
- to identify and characterize the composition and risk profile of the two anonymized portfolios.

The results show that:
- the ETF universe spans a wide range of risk profiles, from defensive fixed-income exposures to more volatile assets;
- the first mystery allocation is well explained by a static combination of ETFs, with a strong equity-oriented exposure;
- the second allocation exhibits a more dynamic structure, with a more diversified and slightly more cyclical exposure.

This work applies standard quantitative finance, data analysis, and linear modeling techniques within a reproducible and economically interpretable framework.
