# Academic Work 
Welcome,

This repository gathers a selection of projects completed during my academic studies, focusing on modeling, numerical optimization, econometrics, and finance.

The purpose of this GitHub repository is to share reproducible code, reports, and quantitative results in a clear and structured way, making them easily accessible and usable by recruiters and professionals.
